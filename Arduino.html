  <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
  Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a software 
  or IDE(Integrated Development Environment) that is used to write and upload computer code to the Arduino board.
  Arduino has a large family of boards made according to their proccessing capacity, number of I/O pins, size required, etc...
